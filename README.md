This study presents a novel integrated framework combining Sparse Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the Fuzzy VIKOR method for water pipeline route selection while addressing limitations of traditional multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods in this context. A dataset of existing pipeline routes, evaluated against sustainable de-velopment features categorized into operational, environmental, and socio-economic dimensions, forms the foundation of this research. These routes were assessed by engineering committees using a fuzzy linguistic approach, resulting in a comprehensive decision matrix. The Sparse DNN model leverages this historical dataset to predict decision matrix elements for new alternative pipeline routes, preventing time-intensive data gathering process, and improving feature selection in high-dimensional context.
